- Verified the existing FastAPI skeleton under `src/api` already provides `create_app()` and a `/healthz` route with a simple JSON health payload.
- Verified the existing API test uses `fastapi.testclient.TestClient` to assert `/healthz` returns HTTP 200 and `{"status": "ok"}`.
- Did not run `bash docs/skills/python-test-env/scripts/run_tests.sh` in this environment because the active task instructions explicitly said to skip tests here.

- Kept the existing FastAPI service skeleton under `src/api` and left `create_app()` plus `/healthz` as the backend entry point for later routes.
- Updated the health route to `async def` and replaced the health check test with an `httpx.ASGITransport` request path after reproducing a deadlock in the installed `fastapi.testclient.TestClient` stack.
- Ran `bash docs/skills/python-test-env/scripts/run_tests.sh -- tests/test_api_health.py` and got `1 passed in 0.20s`.
